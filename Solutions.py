# This file contains the solutions for different activities

# Square Code:
# forward(#) # Any number they choose
# right(90)
# forward(#)
# right(90)
# forward(#)
# right(90)
# forward(#)

# Triangle Code:
# forward(#) # Any number they choose
# right(120) # Any direction works as long as it is 120 degrees, and the same direction
# forward(#)
# right(120)
# forward(#)
# right(120)

# Triangle + Loop:
# for i in range(3): # Number of times the loop runs (3)
#   forward(#) # *ADD INDENT!*
#   right(120)

# Triangle and Square as Loops:
# for i in range(4):
# 	forward(#)
# 	right(90)
# for i in range(3):
#     forward(#)
#     right(120)

# Star Code:
# for i in range(5):
    # forward(#) # Any Value Works
    # right(144) # Any direction works

# Function Code:
# def triangle(x):
#     for i in range(3):  # Number of times the loop runs (3)
#         forward(  # ) # Any Number works
#             right(120)

#
# def star(x):  # Any parameters can be put in
#     for i in range(5):
#
#
# forward(x)  # Inputted value will be used for x
# right(144)
#
# star(100)  # Makes a star with sides of 100 pixels
# star(50)  # Makes a star with sides of 50 pixels

# Function code of all shapes
# def square(x):
# 	for i in range(4): # indents matter!
#       forward(x)
#       right(90)
# def triangle(x):
#   for i in range(3):
#       forward(x)
#       right(120)
# def star(x):
#   for i in range(5):
#       forward(x)
# 		right(144)

# Example for drawing activity using circles
# for i in range(60):
# 	circle(100) # Default function that draws a circle
# 	right(6) # Either direction works, as long as the number of repetitions x the degree change = 360ยบ
